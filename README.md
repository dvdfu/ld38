# Honey Home
## Ludum Dare 38

When it rains, it pours. Guide your bees back to their hive to stay out of the weather! Visit flowers to get some bee reinforcement, and bring as many bees back home while avoiding the massive dangers of the tiny bee world.

Honey Home was made in under 72 hours by David Fu, Hamdan Javeed and Seikun Kambashi for Ludum Dare 38 with the theme "Small World".

"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible." - Bee Movie (2007)
